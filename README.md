# fake-hr

[![Powered by skuba](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤿%20skuba-powered-009DC4)](https://github.com/seek-oss/skuba)

fake-hr is a Node.js package that contains limited HR data sets.

It can be plugged into generators like [Chance] and [Faker] to supplement their built-in data sets,
and is intentionally abstracted away from SEEK's own data structures and knowledge graphs.

We use this to generate mock data for our [GraphQL Playground] and [Wingman mockup].

## Release

This package is published to the public npm registry with a GitHub Actions [release workflow].

The workflow runs on select branches:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      # add others as necessary
      - beta
      - master
      # - alpha
```

It depends on this repo being hosted on [seek-oss] with appropriate access.

To set up this repo for publishing, follow the instructions in our [OSS npm package guidance].

### Releasing latest

Commits to the `master` branch will be released with the `latest` tag,
which is the default used when running `npm install` or `yarn install`.

### Releasing other dist-tags

**[semantic-release]** prescribes a branch-based workflow for managing [distribution tags].

You can push to other branches to manage betas, maintenance updates to prior major versions, and more.

Here are some branches that **semantic-release** supports by default:

| Git branch | npm dist-tag |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| master     | latest       |
| alpha      | alpha        |
| beta       | beta         |
| next       | next         |
| 1.x        | release-1.x  |

For more information, see the **semantic-release** docs on [triggering a release].
