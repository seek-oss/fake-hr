# fake-hr

[![Powered by skuba](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤¿%20skuba-powered-009DC4)](https://github.com/seek-oss/skuba)

fake-hr is a Node.js package that contains limited HR data sets.

It can be plugged into generators like [Chance] and [Faker] to supplement their built-in data sets,
and is intentionally abstracted away from SEEK's own data structures and knowledge graphs.

We use this to generate mock data for our [GraphQL Playground] and [Wingman mockup].
